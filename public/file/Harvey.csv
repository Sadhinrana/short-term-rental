The bathroom is shared, definitely bring your own soap, it was not provided. All his personal items were out in the bathroom. We had to look around for towels ( no introduction). The bathroom floor mat was a folded towel. Floors and toilet could have used deeper cleaning. The shower head is really nice. Transportation to NOLA was super easy, there's a bus stop right out side the complex that takes you right into NOLA for cheap, takes like an hour. Uber works well too and is more time effective but is quite more pricey. There's also the ferry in Algiers that takes you right into the french q. for $2 each way.

My husband had to work on a nearby electrical project for a week for long hours, which left me and my cattle dog (Penny) on our own during the day without a vehicle. But instead of feeling lonely and bored, it was like being at a peaceful, spiritual retreat. Penny and I loved sitting on the porch listening to a symphony of songbirds. Multiple orioles and catbirds came to the feeder, and a sweet little wren came in and out of its quirky little home above a life-sized metal knight. The house was warm and inviting, with so many fascinating and interesting items on the walls. I told my husband that this was a home that is a testament to a life lived well. Jeannie has much to be proud of. She is clearly an interesting person with a wonderful story. Penny and I also had a wonderful time exploring the property. Don’t expect a sterile suburban cookie cutter environment. I loved the wilderness feel and the eclectic artifacts scattered about, including an authentic rough hewn log cabin, and an ancient airplane. Harvey is a tiny town of 277 people (according to the town sign), and Penny and I enjoyed walking every single street in the town over three days, and also biking out to the train trestle bridge on the outskirts of town. It was so interesting to see all of the different homes, most humble, but many clearly loved and maintained, often with quirky fun touches. The people we met on our wanderings were unfailingly warm and welcoming. Bob and I even stopped in “Peggy’s Place,” the only bar in town, and had the best time talking with the locals, who clearly enjoyed hearing about our upstate New York lifestyle, and gave us great recommendations. Peggy was the BEST. She even hooked us up with personalized pens and beer coosies! Overall, a great experience, one that I highly recommend. Thank you Jeannie, and the rest of the people in Harvey who were so welcoming!"",""username"":""Renee""},{""date"":""2019-08-12T20:26:27.000Z"",""dateSeen"":""2019-10-20T18:03:00.000Z"",""rating"":5.0,""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22666298""],""text"":""What a gem of a find!
